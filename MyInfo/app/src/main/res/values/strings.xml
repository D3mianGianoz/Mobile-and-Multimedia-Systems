    <string name="self_description">Bye! I\'m Damiano and I\'m from Ivrea, a small town in Piedmont where the Olivetti company was born, grew up and died.
        I\'m 22 years old and I\'m in my first year of the Master\'s degree: Artificial Intelligence at the University of Turin.
        I know and have used the following programming languages: C, Java, Kotlin, Haskell, Python.
        I am here thanks to the Erasmus+ program for the summer semester and I was impressed by the greatness of the Polytechnic and the beauty of Wroclaw.</string>
